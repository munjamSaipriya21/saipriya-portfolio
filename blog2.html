                    <p> These resembles the phases in the life of a person.</p>
                 
                    <p>The rising wave dontes the peak good moments that one can experience if his life.</p>

                <h2>Books</h2>
    
                    <p>Books are the best companions one can have.</p>
       
                    <p>A good book will talk to you and even listen to you. </p>
                    <p>Some books helps you in finding you in yourself.It reflects the way you think and the way you live.</p>
                    <p>You can lie to your friend because he will be speaking with you .But you cannot lie to a book because it speaks with the person inside you.</p>
                   
                    <p>So it's good to have a good book with you rather than having 1000 friends around you.</p>
                    <p>Finally my suggestion is that you must read a good book, atleast one book in a month.</p>
